                    Our history starts with the owner and manager of The Krusty Krab, Mr Krabs aka Eugene Krabs. Mr Krabs has a love for money so he opened up The Krusty Krab. Mr Krabs opened up the resturant in 1999 shown in the first episode "help wanted" according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krusty_Krab. Mr Krabs has employed both Spongebob SquarePants as fry cook and Squidward Tentacles as cashier to work at The Krusty Krab. Spongebob loves The Krusty Krab whereas squidward would rather be somewhere away from Spongebob, but apart from this it was all a bit of fun to open up the resturant in Bikini Bottom. The resturant became very popular because of there homemade burgers called the Krabby Patty. This is the main burger they show at The Krusty Krab and everyone seems to have a love for there fantastic flavour and taste from there own secret formular. This secret formular has been keeped safe from everybody apart from Mr Krabs and Spongebob. The Krappy Patty is defiently the dish to buy at the Krusty Krab. From Mr Krabs past he started a business with Plankton when he found out this secret formular. Plankton doesn't know about this formular and always continues to try and get it from Mr Krabs. This is because Plankton owns a resturant called The Chum Bucket that is located across the road from The Krusty Krab. Plankton wants to steal the recipe because he is trying to compete with Mr Krabs to get costomers 
                    If you see Plankton stop him! Other than the Krabby Patty being an all time favourite the Krusty Krab also has sold many other food such as french fries, coral bites, kelp rings and kelp shakes/drinks.
